## Introduction
 
### Kinematics
* The study or specification of motion, independent of the underlying physics that created the motion.
* Articulated Figure: A figure made up of a series of links (bones) connected at joints.
* Forward Kinematics: Given the character's state, calculate its pose

* Inverse Kinematice: Given the character's pose, calculate its state

### Motion Capture
* Live action recording
* track motion of reference points
* convert to joint angles to drive an articulated 3D model
* drive a deformable surface
 
### Motion Editing
* Get a specific motion
* Want something else while preserving original
 
 

## Ordinary Differential Equations
### Differential Equations
* describes the **relation between an unknown function and its derivatives**
* solving a differential equation is to **find a function that satisfies the relation**
 
### First-Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)
* All derivatives are with respect to a single independent **variable**, usually representing **time**

* Higher ODE can be transformed into this 1st order system.
 
### Higher-Order ODEs
